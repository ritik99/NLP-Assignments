books, and alternating fromweek to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of thedrug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature </s>', '<s> He was still,as ever, deeply attracted  the study of crime, and occupied hisimmense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation infollowing out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries whichhad been abandoned as hopeless  the official

deduce from it?\"', '<s> I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it waswritten </s>', '<s> \"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\" I remarked,endeavouring to imitate my

remains, therefore, to discoverwhat is wanted  this German who writes upon Bohemian paper andprefers wearing a mask to showing his face </s>', '<s> And here he comes, ifI am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts </s>\"', \"<s> As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs andgrating wheels against the curb, followed  a sharp pull at thebell </s>\", '<s> Holmes whistled </s>', '<s> \"A

hardly have been less than six feet sixinches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules </s>', '<s> Hisdress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be lookedupon as akin to bad

how did you deduce thatthis man was intellectual?\"', '<s> For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head </s>', '<s> It came rightover the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose </s>', '<s> \"It isa question of cubic capacity,\" said he; \"a man with so large abrain must have something in it </s>\"', '<s> \"The decline of his fortunes, then?\"', '<s> \"This hat is three years old </s>', '<s> These flat brims curled at the edgecame in then </s>', '<s> It is a hat of the very best quality </s>', '<s> Look at theband of ribbed silk and the excellent lining </s>', '<s> If this man

about theforesight and the moral retrogression?\"', '<s> Sherlock Holmes laughed </s>', '<s> \"Here is the foresight,\" said he puttinghis finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer </s>', '<s> \"They are never sold upon hats </s>', '<s> If this man ordered one, it is asign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of hisway to take this precaution against the wind
